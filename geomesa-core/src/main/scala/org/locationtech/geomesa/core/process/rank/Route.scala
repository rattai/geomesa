/**
 * A MotionScore rolls up statistics computed for one single sequence of pings along the route or track. The 
 * EvidenceOfMotion object used in the ranking process is an aggregation of one or more MotionScores for a single ID / 
 * entity across many groups of pings that have been segmented to match potential tracks. In the following comments we
 * refer to each sequence of pings as a "tracklet"
 * @param numberOfPings the number of pings in the tracklet 
 * @param cumulativePathDistance the distance along the tracklet
 * @param queryRouteDistance the distance along the query route or track 
 * @param cumulativeDistanceFromRoute the cumulative distance that the tracklet deviates from the route or track,
 *                                    calculated by dividing the track or route up into n divisions (100 by default) and
 *                                    calculating the closest distance from the route to the tracklet at each division
 * @param speedStats max, min, avg, and stddev of speed calculated along the tracklet
 * @param stddevOfHeading a measure of consistency for the heading associated with the tracklet
 * @param queryRouteStddevOfHeading a measure of consistency for the heading associated with the route
